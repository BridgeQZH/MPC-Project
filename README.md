## TODO:
* Paper Work
    + ~~Solve the linear quadrotor dynamics. Get Jacobian matrix around the equilibrium.(Q1)~~

* Code Implementation
    + ~~Change linear pendulum model from the assignment to linear quadrotor model in this project.~~

    + ~~Discretize the linear model to get discrete time dynamics.~~
    
    + ~~Modify simulation.py~~

    + ~~give specific control input and simulate.~~
    
    + Keep the branches or merge them into master? Motivate your answer!
